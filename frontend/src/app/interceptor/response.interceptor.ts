/* Intercepting the Response: After a request is sent to the server, a response is returned. This response is intercepted by the ResponseInterceptor.
Checking the Event Type: The tap operator checks if the event is an instance of HttpResponse using the line if (event instanceof HttpResponse). If it is, this means that a response has been received from the server.
Logging the Response: If the event is a HttpResponse, the interceptor logs the response to the console with console.log('Response received in interceptor:', event);. This allows you to see the full response, including headers, body, and status, in your browserâ€™s console.
Continuing the Observable Stream: After logging, the HttpResponse continues through the Observable stream. If there are more interceptors, they will process this response next. Finally, the response is returned to the service or component that made the original HTTP request. */
